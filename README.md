Most undergraduate work since 2014 advised by Professor Nuria Calvet at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Classwork_MachineLearning: For ASTRO 406 (astronomy and numerical methods) taught by Prof. Oleg Gnedin. Ended in class project incorporating machine learning classifiers. 
Color_Color_Populations: Color-color diagrams are a tool for comparing multiple wavelengths and photometric measurements for disks. Allows to pick out disks that have signatures of planet formation
HAEBE_Bfields: Work with PI Megan Reiter searching for good targets with magnetic fields to take spectra, which is difficult around higher mass protostars.
Meeus Stars: the original sample of protostars that inspired work on disk structure
Reports: reports on searching for and modeling high-mass sources of interest from our color-color diagrams
Scripts_And_Data: sample of programs used to query for data from IPAC (getData), and investigate their SEDs (spectral signatures). Not shown is private work for adviser using models written in FORTRAN (using scripts and makefiles in csh).
